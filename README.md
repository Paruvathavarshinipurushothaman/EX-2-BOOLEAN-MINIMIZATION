# EX-2-BOOLEAN-MINIMIZATION
AIM: 

To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming. 

F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D 

F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy 

Equipment Required: 

Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher 

Software – Quartus prime 

Procedure 

Type the program in Quartus software. 

Compile and run the program. 

Generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram. 

Create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram. 

For different input combinations generate the timing diagram.

Result: 

Thus, the given logic functions are implemented using and their operations are verified using Verilog programming.
